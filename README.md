# My Website on Dubai Tourism

This is my first attempt at making a website on tourism in Dubai, one of the most popular cities in the world (and also my favourite!).
I have made use of the [Agency](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/agency/) template from [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) which has helped me understand the programming for creating and managing responsive portfolio grids, responsive timeline and several content sections.<br>
It features attractions, food and dining and a section on shopping as well :)
